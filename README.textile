h1. Strappy - Choosy

Bootstrap a Rails 2.3 app with a template

h2. What does this thing have in it

  * Haml 2.1
  * Haml views
  * Sass stylesheets
  * jQuery 1.3
  * jQueryUI 1.5
  * Blackbird for UI debugging
  * CC.rb rake task
  * Capistrano with Staging and Production environments
  * A defualt 'home' controller in place of index.html
  * A strappy rake task to install commonly used plugins (lifted from Bort)

Admittedly this thing kind of steps out side of the box in what I believe they 
intended application templates to do by bringing in controllers and specs.
  
h3. gems

  * GemTools to manage gems and versions
  * SiteConfig to manage the app congiguration
  * RSpec for testing
  * Rcov to help make sure you are testing
  * WillPaginate for pagination
  * ExposeModel to tidy up your controllers and views
  
h3. plugins

  * jRails to handle jQuery
  
h3. Authentication

Choose your option from:

  * A ready to go Authlogic app, with password resets
  * A ready to go Clearance app
  * A ready to go restful_authentication app
  * Or none of the above
  
If you choose Clearance you will be given the option to choose a different 
hashing algorithm. The options are SHA512 or BCrypt (requires a gem), the 
default is SHA1

h2. Usage

  rails -m http://github.com/tedkulp/strappy/raw/master/base.rb app_name
